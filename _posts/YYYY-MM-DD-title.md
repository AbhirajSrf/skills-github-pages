# **My Journey into Tech: The First Steps**

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹  

Today, Iâ€™m excited to share the beginning of my journey into the world of technology and software development. Itâ€™s been a mix of curiosity, challenges, and small victories, but every step has been worth it.  

## **How It All Started**  
Growing up in Dharan, I always loved tinkering with gadgets. What fascinated me the most was how lines of code could create something as simple as a webpage or as complex as an AI model. This curiosity led me to pursue a bachelor's degree at **Birendra Memorial College**, where I started building a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.  

## **My First Project**  
My first real project was a simple web application that allowed users to organize tasks. It wasnâ€™t perfect, but it taught me a lot about coding, debugging, and perseverance. The joy of creating something from scratch fueled my passion for learning more.  

## **Lessons Iâ€™ve Learned So Far**  
1. **Never Stop Learning**: Technology evolves quickly, and staying updated is essential.  
2. **Embrace Failure**: Every error and bug is an opportunity to grow.  
3. **Share and Collaborate**: Community and teamwork make the journey enjoyable.
